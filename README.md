# solarsystem
A 2D solarsystem made by only Javascript.

I spent 6 hours in total to create this 2D solarsystem programmed in Javascript. The solarsystem has one sun and 6 planets
instead of 9 (I was too lazy sorry xD). 

I used modules instead of writing all the code in one file. The project looks better and clearly now everything has been seprated. 

I also used my own selector library (g.js).
